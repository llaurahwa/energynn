# energynn

This was a project I pursued to explore time-series forecasting. 
I trained a LSTM neural network using RELU activation layers to forecast future building HVAC energy consumption based on seasonal patterns.
I used the Keras library for the neural network algorithms.
Most of the project was focused on cleaning and preparing training data.
