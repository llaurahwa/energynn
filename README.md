This was a project I pursued to explore time-series forecasting. 
I trained a LSTM neural network using RELU activation layers to forecast future building HVAC energy consumption based on seasonal patterns.
I used the Keras library for the neural network algorithms. My training data is from the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III contest on Kaggle.
Most of the project was focused on cleaning and preparing data.
